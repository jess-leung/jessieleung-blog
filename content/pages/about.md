## Workshop Facilitator & Presenter
Occasionally I've hosted a meetup and/or presented a workshop/talk. Some ones to note: 
- Hosted [Android beginner workshops](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Sydney/events/244650072/) at Women Who Code Sydney, in both Java and Kotlin to teach attendees how to make a basic asynchronous messaging Android application which makes an API call to NodeJS backend and basic layouts.

## Writer @ Medium
I write on Medium as a hobby. I've published under publications such as Better Programming, e.g. [The Benefits of Pair Programming](https://medium.com/better-programming/when-pair-programming-works-it-works-really-well-heres-why-c51857bbcf0f?source=friends_link&sk=a70583b89969df79214763e48a9a02b0)  which have been featured in Medium's Software Engineering and Programming topics.
